# NHA Spring 2017 Scripting Class
This repo is where I will be putting all of my work from the Nano Hacker Academy scripting class in Spring 2017.
### [Week 1 - Assignment 1](https://github.com/kieracawley/Scripting-NHA-Spring-2017/blob/master/Malformed%20Telephone%20Numbers%20(Week%201%20Part%201)/malformed_telephone_numbers.rb)
The assignment was to write ruby code that goes through a [.csv file](https://github.com/kieracawley/Scripting-NHA-Spring-2017/blob/master/Malformed%20Telephone%20Numbers%20(Week%201%20Part%201)/import_telephone_numbers.csv)) with 1000 phone numbers and put them into the format 1-###-###-####. Many of the numbers had letters, symbols, and emojis added in them and they were all in different formats, some with the 1 at the beginning and some without it.
